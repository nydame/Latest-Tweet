### Welcome!

Latest Tweet is (thus far) a bare bones jQuery plugin that displays the latest tweet of a given entity on Twitter on a website.  The username and number of tweets to search for a valid tweet can be supplied as parameters.  Valid tweets are neither retweets nor replies (i.e., tweets starting with "@"). Eventually a WordPress plugin will be developed through increasingly feature-rich branches. 

To use 
1. create a div with id="twitter" in your markup to contain the tweet, 
2. download latest-tweet.js., and edit the values of *username* and (if desired) *num*
3. upload the resulting code to your website, either as a separate file or added to an existing javascript file
